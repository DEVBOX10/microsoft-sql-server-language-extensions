Welcome to the SQL Server Language Extensions project!

Starting in SQL Server 2019, we have added support for language extensibility, which means that you can now execute code in various languages like R, Python and Java from SQL Server.

To download the released prebuilt versions of these extensions, go to the [Releases section of this repository](https://github.com/microsoft/sql-server-language-extensions/releases). Download the latest version of whichever extension corresponds to your machine configuration (Windows or Linux). There are separate releases for each language extension.

We hope you enjoy using Microsoft SQL Server and the language extension feature.

You can read more about how to use language extensions and how to use Java in SQL Server 2019 in the Microsoft [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/language-extensions/language-extensions-overview?view=sqlallproducts-allversions).

Tutorials and documentation for the R and Python extensions can be found here:
